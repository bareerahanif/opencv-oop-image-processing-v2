# OOPCV Image Processing Project

## Introduction
This project aims to implement various image processing tasks using object-oriented programming (OOP) concepts and OpenCV library in C++. It involves creating a structure to handle grayscale and colored images, and implementing functions to perform image processing operations.

## Functions Implemented

### Binarize Image
Converts the image into a binary image, where each pixel can have only two possible values (0 or 255).

### Crop Image
Crops the image based on given coordinates (x, y) and dimensions (height, width).

### Rotate Image
Rotates the image by the specified angle (90, 180, or 270 degrees).

### Adjust Color
Increases or decreases the color (red/green/blue) of the image by the specified values.

### Channel Levels
Ensures each channel of the image has the specified levels or distinct values (2/4/8/16/32/64/128).
